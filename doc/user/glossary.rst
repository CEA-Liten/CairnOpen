	Cairn
	  Cairn is the new name of PERSEE (oPtimizER for System Energy managEment)

	MILP
	  Mixed Integer Linear Problem
	  
	GUI
	  Graphic User Interface
	  
	HMI
	  Human Machine Interface
	  
	API
	  Application Programming Interface

	LCA
	  Life Cycle Assessment
	  
	CPLEX
	  The CPLEX Optimizer was named for the simplex method implemented in the C programming language.
	  The IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer solves integer programming problems, very large linear programming problems using either primal 
	  or dual variants of the simplex method or the barrier interior point method, 
	  convex and non-convex quadratic programming problems, and convex quadratically constrained problems
	  (solved via second-order cone programming, or SOCP)
	  
	GAMS
	  General Algebraic Modeling System	
	  
	  GAMS is a high level modeling system for mathematical programming and optimization. It consists of a language compiler and a range of associated solvers.
	  The GAMS modeling language allows modelers to quickly translate real world optimization problems into computer code. 
	  The gams language compiler then translates this code into a format the solvers can understand and solve. 
	  This architecture provides great flexibility, by allowing changing the solvers used without changing the model formulation.

	FMU
	  Functional Mock-up Unit
	  
	  A file (with extension.fmu) that contains a simulation model that adheres to the FMI standard.
	  
	FMI
	  Functional Mock-up Interface is an open standard for exchanging dynamical simulation models between different 
	  tools in a standardized format. 
	  
	JSON
	  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. 
	  It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed 
	  on a web page, or vice versa). 
	  
	MODELICA
		Modelica is an object oriented language to model cyber-physical systems. 
		It supports acausal connection of reusable components governed by mathematical equations to facilitate modeling from first principles.
	  
	PEGASE
		**PEGASE** is a co-simulation platform developped by CEA, based on FBSF layer developped by L3S (open source since 2021: https://github.com/L-3S/SiFFra).

	CSV
		Comma-separated values (CSV) is a text file format that uses commas to separate values, and newlines to separate records.
		A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, where each line of the file typically represents one data record. 
		Each record consists of the same number of fields, and these are separated by commas in the CSV file. 
		If the field delimiter itself may appear within a field, fields can be surrounded with quotation marks.
		The CSV file format is one type of delimiter-separated file format.
		Delimiters frequently used include the comma, tab, space, and semicolon. 
		Delimiter-separated files are often given a ".csv" extension even when the field separator is not a comma. 
		Many applications or libraries that consume or produce CSV files have options to specify an alternative delimiter.
	  
	COP 
		The coefficient of performance or COP (sometimes CP or CoP) of a heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system 
		is a ratio of useful heating or cooling provided to work (energy) required.
		
		Higher COPs equate to higher efficiency, lower energy (power) consumption and thus lower operating costs.
		The COP is used in thermodynamics.
		The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because instead of just converting work to heat
		(which, if 100% efficient, would be a COP of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to 
		where the heat is required. 
		
		The COP is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature 
		between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions.
		
	Python
		Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
		Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
		Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
		including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
		It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

	CAPEX
		CAPital EXpenditure or CAP EXpense is the money an organization or corporate entity spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets, such as equipment, vehicle and so on.

	OPEX
		An OPerating EXpense is an ongoing cost for running a equipement or system. In Cairn, it represents the maintenance of the component.
		
	NPV
	    Net Present Value is the sum of the levelized cash flows.
	    NPV > 0 means that the project is profitable (incomes cover the expenses, the investment can be paid back, an excess profit is created).
		
	IRR
	    Internal Rate of Return is the rate for which the cash flows pay back the investment (NPV=0).
		
	LCOE
	    Levelized Cost of Energy is the cost for which energy must be sold to cancel the NPV (NPV=0).
	
	UDI
	    User Defined Indicator
	
	TURPE
		The financial resources required for system operators to carry out their public service missions are obtained mainly 
		through the public transmission system access tariff (TURPE, Tarifs d'Utilisation des Réseaux Publics d'Electricité).
    
	Ancillary services
		Ancillary services are all actions of grid users that help grid operator to maintain the balance on the transmission grid.
		Most important ancillary services are reserve products (R1, R2, R3, R3DP etc), voltage regulation and black-start capability.	

	LHV
		Lower Heating Value
