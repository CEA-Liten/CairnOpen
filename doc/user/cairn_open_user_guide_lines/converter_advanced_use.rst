#####################
Build a problem
#####################

In the following section the user can find practical informations concerning the basics for building up a problem in the |cairn| platform.

Getting started: Launch |cairn|
================================

To start |cairn|, run the provided **RunGui.bat** file. This will initialize the software and the graphical user interface (|gui|) will open. 
In order to create a new problem once the |gui| is open :

- Navigate to the **File** menu at the top-left part of the interface.
- Select **New Project** from the drop-down options as showed in :numref:`FigFirstProject`.
- A new window will appear. Here you can insert the name of your project and specify the path where you want to save it. 
- Now, click **Ok** to create your working files.

   :name: FigFirstProject
   :align: center

   Creating your first project

.. note::
      At this stage, the |cairn| team highly recommends saving your study in a folder with the same name as your project. 
      Since this phase (and future ones) will generate multiple files, it is best practice to keep everything organized in one folder.


Drag and drop components
========================

As the user can see, the **Study Data** frame now displays **your projectâ€™s .json** file, named after your project. 
This file has been successfully uploaded into the system.

In the |gui| interface, three base components will appear, providing the core structure for building your project. 
Additionally, the **Component Model Library** frame, located on the left side of the screen, is now accessible.

As shown in :numref:`TypeofComponents`, |cairn| organizes the components into four categories. 
These categories will guide the user in selecting the necessary elements to construct their project.

.. container:: cadre 

    .. figure:: images/Init_2.JPG
	   :alt: 4 Type of Components
	   :width: 600
	   :align: center
	   :name: TypeofComponents

	   4 Type of Components listed in |cairn|

- The first category defines the base components, which are essential to define the backbone of the optimization problem
  (Objective function, Environmental impacts, Optimization algorithm settings and time horizon configuration).
- The second category defines the energy carriers of your problem, and the physical properties associated.
	.. seealso:: 

		a. :ref:`SetEnergyVector`.

- The third category defines the physycal models of your problem. The different modules provided replicate the physical 
  behavior of existant technologies. More information can find in the Submodule Chapter. 
- The last category defines the constraint components, which allows to set the constraints to your optimization problem.

As it can be seen, |cairn| adopts a **modular approach**, which allows users to model complex energy systems with a high degree of flexibility. 

These component blocks can be easily **dragged and dropped** into the graphical user interface (|gui|). 

By connecting the components, the user effectively writes the equations governing energy flows, operational limits, and other constraints within the system. 

.. hint::
   A highly efficient way of working with |cairn| is to first **conceptualize** the energy system you are studying. 
   Visualize how the different components of the system should be interconnected to achieve the desired energy flow and performance.
   Once the system is clearly imagined, all you need to do is recreate it in |cairn| using the **drag-and-drop** functionality.

Using :numref:`SampleofFirstArchi` as a reference, you can begin building the energy system in |cairn|. 
Start by identifying the components in the system and **dragging** the corresponding module from the 
**Component Model Library** to the working space on the |gui|.

|

.. hint::    
   Better start from the carriers that are going to be used in the system, 
   in order to easily connect later on the components between eachother. 

.. container:: cadre 

	.. figure:: images/Init_3.JPG
		   :alt: Sample of the first architecture to be represented

		   Sample of the first architecture to be represented

Each module represents a part of the energy system. For example :

   - If you need a diesel generation unit, drag the module that represents a cogeneration generator.
   - For energy storage, select the appropriate carrier storage component.

So far, we should have something similar to :numref:`DragandDrop`.

.. container:: cadre 

	.. figure:: images/Init_4.JPG

	   :name: DragandDrop

Now we need to make the connections between the components.

How to manage big architectures?
================================

The |gui| allows to create several pages to manage big architectures.
      
Each page can hold 150 components.

.. figure:: images/MultiPages.PNG
   :name: MultiPages
   :width: 400
   :align: center

   Pages management, adding a page opens a popup to name the page.

The definition of an energy carrier is shared between all the pages.

Links between the pages can be done through the buses: a bus can be "cloned" by righting clicking on it.

.. figure:: images/CloningBus.PNG
   :name: CloningBus
   :width: 600
   :align: center

   Cloning a bus to another page in order to be able to add a new port useable in the other page.

Removing a page deletes all the components except the energy vectors used in other pages.

.. note::

   A page can be renamed by right-clicking on an empty space on the page and clicking the Rename page function.

How to use groups?
==================

Group of components can be created.

To do so, select all the components that should be in the group. Right click in the page and select "Create a group".

.. figure:: images/CreateGroup.PNG

   The steps of a group creation.

Once the group is created, its name can be changed at the top left of it. At the top right, it can be reduced or expanded.

.. figure:: images/GroupOptions.PNG
   :name: GroupOptions
   :width: 600
   :align: center

   Different options are available by right clicking inside the group.

* The main component that is displayed when the group is reduced can be changed.

* The background color can be chosen among a list.

* Adding or removing a component inside the group can be done.

* Exporting the group can be done. Thus, it saved in .json format and it can be importing in another project in File menu/Import group.

* Ungroup the group can also be done here.

.. _load_input_timeseries:
Upload the Input time series
===========================

Now that the architecture is defined on the |gui|, the user can proceed to upload the Input Time Series by using the 
dedicated drop down menu as showed in :numref:`LoadTimeSeries`.

|

.. figure:: images/Init_5.JPG
   :alt: Loading a time series for input data
   :name: LoadTimeSeries

   :align: center

   Loading a time series for input data

After clicking on it, the user will upload the .csv file associated with the proper format.
As soon as the Time Series is uploaded, the user can verify if the data has been correcly imported by using the plotter of |cairn|.

To do so, click on **Results** in the left frame **Study Data**, and then follow the same instructions as for plotting the Results.
