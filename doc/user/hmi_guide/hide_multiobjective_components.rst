The MultiObjective components are shown when the color of the button is green, and they are hidden when the color of the button is red. 

.. note:: 
	
   Hiding the MultiObjective components doesn't modify the study and doesn't affect the result of the simulation. It is only a feature to display the architecture 
   without the MultiObjective connections.
